## üõ† How Fisheye Distortion Correction Works

### üîπ What is Fisheye Distortion?
Fisheye lenses provide an **ultra-wide field of view**, often exceeding **180¬∞**, making them useful for robotics, drones, and SLAM applications. However, they introduce **radial distortion**, causing straight lines to appear **curved**, especially toward the image edges.  

This distortion can negatively impact:
- **Computer Vision Algorithms** (e.g., object detection, feature matching).  
- **Localization & Mapping** (e.g., SLAM, 3D reconstruction).  
- **Navigation** (e.g., obstacle avoidance in autonomous systems).  

To ensure **accurate scene perception**, we must **correct fisheye distortion** before processing images.

### üîπ How Fisheye Distortion Correction Works
Fisheye distortion correction involves remapping pixels to **remove radial distortion**, effectively "straightening" curved edges.  
This transformation is achieved using **intrinsic camera parameters**, which model the lens distortion.  

#### üîπ Steps in the Correction Process
- **Camera Calibration**  
  - The camera is **calibrated** using a known pattern (e.g., a chessboard).  
  - Intrinsic parameters, such as **focal length, principal point, and distortion coefficients**, are estimated.  
  - These parameters are then used to compute a **correction transformation matrix**.  

- **Remapping Pixels**  
  - Each pixel is mapped to its **corrected position** based on the transformation matrix.  
  - OpenCV's `cv2.undistort()` function applies this remapping, reducing curvature.  
  - Lookup tables ensure fast and efficient correction.  

- **Generating an Undistorted Image**  
  - The corrected image is reconstructed using **`cv2.remap()`**.  
  - Straight lines remain straight, making the image **more suitable for further processing** in robotics, SLAM, and computer vision tasks.

## üõ† How Rectilinear Projection Works

### üîπ Why Rectilinear Projection?
Fisheye distortion correction only **removes radial distortion** but does not change the **perspective of the image**.  
In many cases, we need to go further and **convert the fisheye view into a normal-looking image**‚Äîa process known as **rectilinear projection**.  

This is important because:
- Fisheye images **compress distant objects**, making measurements inaccurate.  
- Many **computer vision algorithms** assume images come from **pinhole cameras** (not fisheye).  
- SLAM and mapping require **undistorted, perspective-correct images** for feature tracking.  

### üîπ How Rectilinear Projection Works
Rectilinear projection **transforms the curved fisheye image into a standard pinhole camera view** by **mapping spherical coordinates to Cartesian coordinates**.

#### üîπ Steps in the Projection Process
- **Convert Fisheye Image to Polar Coordinates**  
  - The fisheye image represents a **spherical perspective**.  
  - Each pixel is converted to **polar coordinates** (`r, Œ∏`) instead of traditional `(x, y)`.  

- **Reproject to Cartesian Space**  
  - The **spherical projection is "unwrapped" into a flat, rectilinear image**.  
  - This ensures objects appear **proportionally correct**, eliminating fisheye warping.  

- **Interpolation & Final Projection**  
  - Since pixel positions are now **non-uniform**, interpolation (bilinear or bicubic) is applied for a smooth transformation.  
  - The final result is a **normal-looking image**, similar to what a regular **pinhole camera** would capture.  

This transformation is critical for **SLAM, 3D reconstruction, and visual perception in robotics**, where **accurate spatial representation** is essential.  

  - Uses **bilinear interpolation** to preserve quality.  
  - Produces a **normal-looking image** similar to a **pinhole camera**.
